# Neumorphic-User-Cards
In this task, I successfully completed a User Card Grid layout using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a responsive design and API integration. The design includes a navbar displaying the brand name and a 'Get Users' button to fetch user data using an API call. The data is presented in a stylish grid format with a loader indicating data fetching in progress.
